Dear Sammy,

Thanks for contacting Gamblin. We are glad you reached out as sustainability is
incredibly important to us.
 
We are in the process of applying for B-Corporation status as a company and in
that effort have been bolstering our commitment to being as eco-friendly as
possible in how we work and operate. We are continuously looking for ways to
improve that are good for artists, our employees, and the planet we are share.     

Here is a link to our website that has our Brand Promise:

unique recycled paint weâ€™ve produced for over 20+ years:

I hope this is helpful, and please do feel free to reach out again if you have
any further questions or comments.

Warm Regards,

Mary
